_Claude Sonnet 4.6 is our most capable Sonnet model yet_. It’s a full upgrade of the model’s skills across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. Sonnet 4.6 also features a 1M token context window in beta.

For those on our [Free and Pro plans](https://claude.com/pricing), Claude Sonnet 4.6 is now the default model in [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.158f5f70-ee7a-4103-a11a-2715e153e93c) and [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork). [Pricing](https://claude.com/pricing#api) remains the same as Sonnet 4.5, starting at $3/$15 per million tokens.

Sonnet 4.6 brings much-improved coding skills to more of our users. Improvements in consistency, instruction following, and more have made developers with early access prefer Sonnet 4.6 to its predecessor by a wide margin. They often even prefer it to our smartest model from November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5.

Performance that would have previously required reaching for an Opus-class model—including on real-world, economically valuable [office tasks](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa)—is now available with Sonnet 4.6. The model also shows a major improvement in computer use skills compared to prior Sonnet models.

As with every new Claude model, we’ve run [extensive safety evaluations](https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card) of Sonnet 4.6, which overall showed it to be as safe as, or safer than, our other recent Claude models. Our safety researchers concluded that Sonnet 4.6 has “a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character, very strong safety behaviors, and no signs of major concerns around high-stakes forms of misalignment.”

## Computer use

Almost every organization has software it can’t easily automate: specialized systems and tools built before modern interfaces like APIs existed. To have AI use such software, users would previously have had to build bespoke connectors. But a model that can use a computer the way a person does changes that equation.

In October 2024, we were the [first to introduce](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) a general-purpose computer-using model. At the time, we wrote that it was “still experimental—at times cumbersome and error-prone,” but we expected rapid improvement. [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/), the standard benchmark for AI computer use, shows how far our models have come. It presents hundreds of tasks across real software (Chrome, LibreOffice, VS Code, and more) running on a simulated computer. There are no special APIs or purpose-built connectors; the model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard.

Across sixteen months, our Sonnet models have made steady gains on OSWorld. The improvements can also be seen beyond benchmarks: early Sonnet 4.6 users are seeing human-level capability in tasks like navigating a complex spreadsheet or filling out a multi-step web form, before pulling it all together across multiple browser tabs.

The model certainly still lags behind the most skilled humans at using computers. But the rate of progress is remarkable nonetheless. It means that computer use is much more useful for a range of work tasks—and that substantially more capable models are within reach.

![Chart comparing several Sonnet model scores on the OSWorld benchmark](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F1206645ef5a618dabce8587b472b21c67a30a0db-3840x1948.png&w=3840&q=75)

Scores prior to Claude Sonnet 4.5 were measured on the original OSWorld; scores from Sonnet 4.5 onward use OSWorld-Verified. OSWorld-Verified (released July 2025) is an in-place upgrade of the original OSWorld benchmark, with updates to task quality, evaluation grading, and infrastructure.

At the same time, computer use poses risks: malicious actors can attempt to hijack the model by hiding instructions on websites in what’s known as a prompt injection attack. We’ve been working to improve our models’ resistance to prompt injections—our [safety evaluations](https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card) show that Sonnet 4.6 is a major improvement compared to its predecessor, Sonnet 4.5, and performs similarly to Opus 4.6. You can find out more about how to mitigate prompt injections and other safety concerns in [our API docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/mitigate-jailbreaks).

## Evaluating Claude Sonnet 4.6

Beyond computer use, Claude Sonnet 4.6 has improved on benchmarks across the board. It approaches Opus-level intelligence at a price point that makes it more practical for far more tasks. You can find a full discussion of Sonnet 4.6’s capabilities and its safety-related behaviors in [our system card](https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card); a summary and comparison to other recent models is below.

![A table of popular benchmarks and Sonnet 4.6's relative performance compared to other frontier models](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F10b2602771d21378cd6d76628a081c8a76dcf216-2600x2960.png&w=3840&q=75)

In Claude Code, our early testing found that users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 roughly 70% of the time. Users reported that it more effectively read the context before modifying code and consolidated shared logic rather than duplicating it. This made it less frustrating to use over long sessions than earlier models.

Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5, our frontier model from November, 59% of the time. They rated Sonnet 4.6 as significantly less prone to overengineering and “laziness,” and meaningfully better at instruction following. They reported fewer false claims of success, fewer hallucinations, and more consistent follow-through on multi-step tasks.

Sonnet 4.6’s 1M token context window is enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request. More importantly, Sonnet 4.6 _reasons effectively_ across all that context. This can make it much better at long-horizon planning. We saw this particularly clearly in the [Vending-Bench Arena](https://andonlabs.com/evals/vending-bench-arena) evaluation, which tests how well a model can run a (simulated) business over time—and which includes an element of competition, with different AI models facing off against each other to make the biggest profits.

Sonnet 4.6 developed an interesting new strategy: it invested heavily in capacity for the first ten simulated months, spending significantly more than its competitors, and then pivoted sharply to focus on profitability in the final stretch. The timing of this pivot helped it finish well ahead of the competition.

![](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8c2855afe51fc0980596b5369b01b0b87eea7eaf-3840x2160.png&w=3840&q=75)

Sonnet 4.6 outperforms Sonnet 4.5 on Vending-Bench Arena by investing in capacity early, then pivoting to profitability in the final stretch.

Early customers also reported broad improvements, with frontend code and financial analysis standing out. Customers independently described visual outputs from Sonnet 4.6 as notably more polished, with better layouts, animations, and design sensibility than those from previous models. Customers also needed fewer rounds of iteration to reach production-quality results.

## Product updates

On the Claude Platform, Sonnet 4.6 supports both [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) and extended thinking, as well as [context compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction) in beta, which automatically summarizes older context as conversations approach limits, increasing effective context length.

On our API, Claude’s [web search](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool) and [fetch](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) tools now automatically write and execute code to [filter and process search results](https://www.claude.com/blog/improved-web-search-with-dynamic-filtering), keeping only relevant content in context—improving both response quality and token efficiency. Additionally, [code execution](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool), [memory](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool), [programmatic tool calling](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling), [tool search](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool), and [tool use examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#providing-tool-use-examples) are now generally available.

Sonnet 4.6 offers strong performance at any thinking effort, even with extended thinking off. As part of your migration from Sonnet 4.5, we recommend exploring across the spectrum to find the ideal balance of speed and reliable performance, depending on what you’re building.

We find that Opus 4.6 remains the strongest option for tasks that demand the deepest reasoning, such as codebase refactoring, coordinating multiple agents in a workflow, and problems where getting it _just_ _right_ is paramount.

For [Claude in Excel](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12650343-using-claude-in-excel) users, our add-in now supports MCP connectors, letting Claude work with the other tools you use day-to-day, like S&P Global, LSEG, Daloopa, PitchBook, Moody’s, and FactSet. You can ask Claude to pull in context from outside your spreadsheet without ever leaving Excel. If you’ve already set up MCP connectors in Claude.ai, those same connections will work in Excel automatically. This is available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.
