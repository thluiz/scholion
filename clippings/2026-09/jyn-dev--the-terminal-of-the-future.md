[Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world)

## a mental model of a terminal[](#a-mental-model-of-a-terminal)

At a very very high level, a terminal has four parts:

1.  The "[terminal emulator](https://wizardzines.com/comics/meet-the-terminal-emulator/)", which is a program that renders a grid-like structure to your graphical display.
2.  The "[pseudo-terminal](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/20/pseudoterminals/)" (PTY), which is a connection between the terminal emulator and a "process group" which receives input. This is not a program. This is a piece of state in the kernel.
3.  The "shell", which is a program that leads the "process group", reads and parses input, spawns processes, and generally acts as an event loop. Most environments use [bash](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/26/bash-quirks/) as the default shell.
4.  The programs spawned by your shell, which interact with all of the above in order to receive input and send output.

I lied a little bit above. "input" is not just text. It also includes [signals](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) that can be sent to the running process. Converting keystrokes to signals is the job of the PTY.

Similar, "output" is not just text. It's a stream of [ANSI Escape Sequences](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797) that can be used by the terminal emulator to display rich formatting.

## what does a better terminal look like?[](#what-does-a-better-terminal-look-like)

I do some [weird things](https://jyn.dev/how-i-use-my-terminal/) with terminals. However, the amount of hacks I can get up to are pretty limited, because terminals are pretty limited. I won't go into all the ways they're limited, because it's been rehashed [many](https://matklad.github.io/2019/11/16/a-better-shell.html) [times](https://github.com/withoutboats/notty) [before](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/05/some-terminal-frustrations/). What I want to do instead is imagine what a better terminal can look like.

### a first try: Jupyter[](#a-first-try-jupyter)

The closest thing to a terminal analog that most people are familiar with is [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/). This offers a lot of cool features that are not possible in a "traditional" VT100 emulator:

*   high fidelity image rendering
    
    ![screenshot of a JupyterLite notebook. It has some python code in a cell that generates a matplotlib chart. Beneath is the chart, rendered to raster graphics.](https://jyn.dev/assets/jupyter%20bubble%20plot.png)
    
*   a "rerun from start" button (or rerun the current command; or rerun only a single past command) that replaces past output instead of appending to it
    
    ![](https://jyn.dev/assets/jupyter%20run%20cells.png)
    
*   "views" of source code and output that can be rewritten in place (e.g. markdown can be viewed either as source or as rendered HTML)
    
    ![](https://jyn.dev/assets/jupyter%20markdown%20raw.png) ![](https://jyn.dev/assets/jupyter%20markdown%20rendered.png)
    
*   a built-in editor with syntax highlighting, tabs, panes, mouse support, etc.
    
    ![](https://jyn.dev/assets/jupyter%20window%20management.png)
    

### some problems[](#some-problems)

Jupyter works by having a "kernel" (in this case, a python interpreter) and a "renderer" (in this case, a web application displayed by the browser). You could imagine using a Jupyter Notebook with a shell as the kernel, so that you get all the nice features of Jupyter when running shell commands. However, that quickly runs into some issues:

*   Your shell gets the commands all at once, not character-by-character, so tab-complete, syntax highlighting, and autosuggestions don't work.
*   What do you do about long-lived processes? By default, Jupyter runs a cell until completion; you can cancel it, but you can't suspend, resume, interact with, nor view a process while it's running. Don't even think about running `vi` or `top`.
*   The "rerun cell" buttons do horrible things to the state of your computer (normal Jupyter kernels have this problem too, but "rerun all" works better when the commands don't usually include `rm -rf`).
*   Undo/redo do _not_ work. (They don't work in a normal terminal either, but people attempt to use them more when it looks like they should be able to.)

It turns out all these problems are solveable.

## how does that work?[](#how-does-that-work)

### shell integration[](#shell-integration)

There exists today a terminal called [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/). Warp has built native integration between the terminal and the shell, where the terminal understands where each command starts and stops, what it outputs, and what is your own input. As a result, it can render things very prettily:

![](https://jyn.dev/assets/warp%20terminal.png)

It does this using (mostly) standard features built-in to the terminal and shell (a custom DCS): you can read their explanation [here](https://www.warp.dev/blog/how-warp-works#:~:text=the%20reason). It's possible to do this less invasively using [OSC 133 escape codes](https://iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html#:~:text=shell%20integration/); I'm not sure why Warp didn't do this, but that's ok.

iTerm2 does a similar thing, and this allows it to enable [really quite a lot of features](https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html#:~:text=enables%20numerous%20features): navigating between commands with a single hotkey; notifying you when a command finishes running, showing the current command as an "overlay" if the output goes off the screen.

### long-lived processes[](#long-lived-processes)

This is really three different things. The first is _interacting_ with a long-lived process. The second is _suspending_ the process without killing it. The third is _disconnecting_ from the process, in such a way that the process state is not disturbed and is still available if you want to reconnect.

#### interacting[](#interacting)

To interact with a process, you need bidirectional communication, i.e. you need a "cell output" that is also an input. An example would be any TUI, like `top`, `gdb`, or `vim` [1](#fn-1)

there are a _lot_ of complications here around [alternate mode](https://ratatui.rs/concepts/backends/alternate-screen/), but I'm just going to skip over those for now. A simple way to handle alternate mode (that doesn't get you nice things) is just to embed a raw terminal in the output cell.

. Fortunately, Jupyter is really good at this! The whole design is around having [interactive outputs](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that you can change and update.

Additionally, I would expect my terminal to always have a "free input cell", as Matklad describes in [A Better Shell](https://matklad.github.io/2019/11/16/a-better-shell.html), where the interactive process runs in the top half of the window and an input cell is available in the bottom half. Jupyter can do this today, but "add a cell" is manual, not automatic.

#### suspending[](#suspending)

"Suspending" a process is usually called "[job control](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/03/reasons-to-use-job-control/)". There's not too much to talk about here, except that I would expect a "modern" terminal to show me all suspended and background processes as a de-emphasized persistent visual, kinda like how Intellij will show you "indexing ..." in the bottom taskbar.

![](https://jyn.dev/assets/intellij%20background%20tasks.png)

#### disconnecting[](#disconnecting)

There are roughly three existing approaches for disconnecting and reconnecting to a terminal session (Well, four if you count [reptyr](https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr)).

1.  Tmux / Zellij / Screen
    
    These tools inject a whole extra terminal emulator between your terminal emulator and the program. They work by having a "server" which actually owns the PTY and renders the output, and a "client" that displays the output to your "real" terminal emulator. This model lets you detach clients, reattach them later, or even attach multiple clients at once. You can think of this as a "batteries-included" approach. It also has the benefit that you can [program](https://jyn.dev/how-i-use-my-terminal/) both the client and the server (although many modern terminals, like [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) are programmable now); that you can organize your tabs and windows in the terminal (although many modern desktop environments have tiling and thorough keyboard shortcuts); and that you get street cred for looking like Hackerman.
    
    ![](https://jyn.dev/assets/hackerman.png)
    
    The downside is that, well, now you have an extra terminal emulator running in your terminal, with [all the bugs that implies](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-am-using-tmux-zellij-and-have-a-problem).
    
    iTerm actually avoids this by [bypassing the tmux client altogether and acting as its own client](https://iterm2.com/documentation-tmux-integration.html) that talks directly to the server. In this mode, "tmux tabs" are actually iTerm tabs, "tmux panes" are iTerm panes, and so on. This is a good model, and I would adopt it when writing a future terminal for integration with existing tmux setups.
    
2.  [Mosh](https://mosh.org/)
    
    Mosh is a really interesting place in the design space. It is not a terminal emulator replacement; instead it is an _ssh_ replacement. Its big draw is that it supports reconnecting to your terminal session after a network interruption. It does that by [running a state machine on the server and replaying an incremental diff of the viewport to the client](https://mosh.org/#:~:text=how%20mosh%20works). This is a similar model to tmux, except that it doesn't support the "multiplexing" part (it expects your terminal emulator to handle that), nor scrollback (ditto). Because it has its own renderer, it has [a similar class of bugs to tmux](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/234). One feature it _does_ have, unlike tmux, is that the "client" is really running on your side of the network, so local line editing is instant.
    
3.  [alden](https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/389)/[shpool](https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool)/[dtach](https://github.com/crigler/dtach)/[abduco](https://github.com/martanne/abduco)/[diss](https://github.com/yazgoo/diss)
    
    These all occupy a similar place in the design space: they _only_ handle session detach/resume with a client/server, not networking or scrollback, and do not include their own terminal emulator. Compared to tmux and mosh, they are highly decoupled.
    

### rerun and undo/redo[](#rerun-and-undo-redo)

I'm going to treat these together because the solution is the same: dataflow tracking.

Take as an example [pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/), which does this _today_ by hooking into the Julia compiler.

![](https://jyn.dev/assets/pluto%20interactive%20ode.gif)

Note that this updates cells live in response to previous cells that they depend on. Not pictured is that it _doesn't_ update cells if their dependencies haven't changed. You can think of this as a spreadsheet-like Jupyter, where code is only rerun when necessary.

You may say this is hard to generalize. The trick here is [orthogonal persistence](https://jyn.dev/complected-and-orthogonal-persistence/#how-far-can-we-take-this). If you sandbox the processes, track all IO, and prevent things that are "too weird" unless they're talking to other processes in the sandbox (e.g. unix sockets and POST requests), you have really quite a lot of control over the process! This lets you treat it as a pure function of its inputs, where its inputs are "the whole file system, all environment variables, and all process attributes".

### derived features[](#derived-features)

Once you have these primitives—Jupyter notebook frontends, undo/redo, automatic rerun, persistence, and shell integration—you can build really quite a lot on top. And you can build it incrementally, piece-by-piece:

#### needs a Jupyter notebook frontend[](#needs-a-jupyter-notebook-frontend)

*   [Runbooks](https://blog.atuin.sh/atuin-desktop-runbooks-that-run/) (actually, you can build these just with Jupyter and a PTY primitive).
*   Terminal customization that uses normal CSS, no weird custom languages or ANSI color codes.
*   Search for commands by output/timestamp. Currently, you can search across output in the current session, or you can search across all command input history, but you don't have any kind of smart filters, and the output doesn't persist across sessions.

#### needs shell integration[](#needs-shell-integration)

*   Timestamps and execution duration for each command.
*   Local line-editing, even across a network boundary.
*   [IntelliSense for shell commands](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-completions/completions), without having to hit tab and with rendering that's integrated into the terminal.

#### needs sandboxed tracing[](#needs-sandboxed-tracing)

*   "[All the features from sandboxed tracing](https://jyn.dev/complected-and-orthogonal-persistence/#but-why)": collaborative terminals, querying files modified by a command, "asciinema but you can edit it at runtime", tracing build systems.
*   Extend the smart search above to also search by disk state at the time the command was run.
*   Extending undo/redo to a git-like branching model (something like this is already support by [emacs undo-tree](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/undo-tree.html#:~:text=undo%20systems)), where you have multiple "views" of the process tree.
*   Given the undo-tree model, and since we have sandboxing, we can give an LLM access to your project, and run many of them in parallel at the same time without overwriting each others state, and in such a way that you can see what they're doing, edit it, and save it into a runbook for later use.
*   A terminal in a prod environment that can't affect the state of the machine, only inspect the existing state.

## ok but how do you build this[](#ok-but-how-do-you-build-this)

jyn, you may say, [you can't build vertical integration in open source](https://becca.ooo/blog/vertical-integration/). [you can't make money off open source projects](https://tech.lgbt/@jyn/112187088917827279). [the switching costs are too high](https://jyn.dev/you-are-in-a-box/#switching-costs-and-growth).

All these things are true. To talk about how this is possible, we have to talk about incremental adoption.

if I were building this, I would do it in stages, such that at each stage the thing is an improvement over its alternatives. This is how `jj` works and it works extremely well: it doesn't require everyone on a team to switch at once because individual people can use `jj`, even for single commands, without a large impact on everyone else.

### stage 1: transactional semantics[](#stage-1-transactional-semantics)

When people think of redesigning the terminal, they always think of redesigning the terminal _emulator_. This is exactly the wrong place to start. People are attached to their emulators. They configure them, they make them look nice, they use their keybindings. There is a high switching cost to switching emulators because [everything affects everything else](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/#everything-affects-everything-else). It's not _so_ terribly high, because it's still individual and not shared across a team, but still high.

What I would do instead is start at the CLI layer. CLI programs are great because they're easy to install and run and have very low switching costs: you can use them one-off without changing your whole workflow.

So, I would write a CLI that implements [transactional semantics for the terminal](https://jyn.dev/complected-and-orthogonal-persistence/#how-far-can-we-take-this). You can imagine an interface something like `transaction [start|rollback|commit]`, where everything run after `start` is undoable. There is a _lot_ you can do with this alone, I think you could build a whole business off this.

### stage 2: persistent sessions[](#stage-2-persistent-sessions)

Once I had transactional semantics, I would try to decouple persistence from tmux and mosh.

To get PTY persistence, you have to introduce a client/server model, because the kernel _really really_ [expects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGHUP) both sides of a PTY to always be connected. Using commands like [alden](https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/389), or a library like it (it's not _that_ complicated), lets you do this simply, without affecting the terminal emulator nor the programs running inside the PTY session.

To get scrollback, the server could save input and output indefinitely and replay them when the client reconnects. This gets you "native" scrollback—the terminal emulator you're already using handles it exactly like any other output, because it looks exactly like any other output—while still being replayable and resumable from an arbitrary starting point. This requires some amount of parsing ANSI escape codes[2](#fn-2)

otherwise you could start replaying output from inside an escape, which is [not good](https://mosh.org/#:~:text=evil%20escape%20sequences). I had a detailed email exchange about this with the alden author which I have not yet had time to write up into a blog post; most of the complication comes when you want to avoid replaying the _entire_ history and only want to replay the visible viewport.

, but it's doable with enough work.

To get network resumption like mosh, my custom server could use [Eternal TCP](https://eternalterminal.dev/howitworks/) (possibly built on top of QUIC for efficiency). Notably, the persistence for the PTY is separate from the persistence for the network connection. Eternal TCP here is strictly an optimization: you could build this on top of a bash script that runs `ssh host eternal-pty attach` in a loop, it's just not as nice an experience because of network delay and packet loss. Again, composable parts allow for incremental adoption.

At this point, you're already able to connect multiple clients to a single terminal session, like tmux, but window management is still done by your terminal emulator, not by the client/server. If you wanted to have window management integrated, the terminal emulator could speak the tmux -CC protocol, like iTerm.

All parts of this stage can be done independently and in parallel from the transactional semantics, but I don't think you can build a business off them, it's not enough of an improvement over the existing tools.

### stage 3: structured RPC[](#stage-3-structured-rpc)

This bit depends on the client/server model. Once you have a server interposed between the terminal emulator and the client, you can start doing really funny things like tagging I/O with metadata. This lets all data be timestamped[3](#fn-3)

and lets you distinguish input from output. [xterm.js](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/20/pseudoterminals/) works something like this. When combined with shell integration, this even lets you distinguish shell prompts from program output, at the _data_ layer.

Now you can start doing really funny things, because you have a _structured log_ of your terminal session. You can replay the log as a recording, like [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)[4](#fn-4)

oh, that's why it seemed like asciinema.

; you can transform the shell prompt without rerunning all the commands; you can import it into a Jupyter Notebook or [Atuin Desktop](https://blog.atuin.sh/atuin-desktop-runbooks-that-run/); you can save the commands and rerun them later as a script. Your terminal is data.

### stage 4: jupyter-like frontend[](#stage-4-jupyter-like-frontend)

This is the very first time that we touch the terminal emulator, and it's intentionally the last step because it has the highest switching costs. This makes use of all the nice features we've built to give you a nice UI. You don't need our `transaction` CLI anymore unless you want nested transactions, because your whole terminal session starts in a transaction by default. You get all the features I mention [above](https://jyn.dev/the-terminal-of-the-future/#derived-features), because we've put all the pieces together.

## jyn, what the fuck[](#jyn-what-the-fuck)

This is bold and ambitious and I think building the whole thing would take about a decade. That's ok. I'm patient.

You can help me by spreading the word :) Perhaps this post will inspire someone to start building this themselves.
