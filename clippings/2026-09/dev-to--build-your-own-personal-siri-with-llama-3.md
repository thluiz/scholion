## [](#setting-up-the-environment)Setting up the Environment 🛠️

Create a folder to keep all your source code for the project:  

```
mkdir siri-voice-llama3
cd siri-voice-llama3
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Create a few new subfolders where we will store the source code, shell scripts, logs and chat history:  

```
mkdir -p src logs src/scripts data/ai_response data/chat_history
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Now that the initial folder structure is set up, it's time to create a new virtual environment and install all the modules we will be using in our project.

Run these commands to create and activate a new virtual environment in the root of our project:  

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # If you are using fish shell, change the activate binary to activate.fish
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Run this command to install all the necessary modules we will be using in our project:  

```
pip3 install SpeechRecognition opencv-python openai google-generativeai gTTS pyttsx3 groq faster-whisper numpy python-dotenv pyperclip pydub PyAudio pillow
```

### [](#setting-up-chat-history-support)Setting Up Chat History Support 📋

> 💡 We are going to add support for chat history in a log file for each day seperately.

Inside the `src` directory, add a file named `utils.py` with the following code:

> In this file, we will store all the helper functions that we will require in our program.  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/utils.py

import os
import sys

    directories are created. If the log file for the current day does not exist,
    it creates an empty log file.

        directory resides.

    Returns:
        Path: The absolute path to the log file for today's date.
    """

    today = datetime.today()

    # The year is always 4 digit and the month, day is always 2 digit using this format.
    year = today.strftime("%Y")
    month = today.strftime("%m")
    day = today.strftime("%d")

    base_folder = os.path.join(
        project_root_folder_path, "data", "chat_history", year, month
    )

    os.makedirs(base_folder, exist_ok=True)

        log_file.write("\n")
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `get_log_file_for_today` function takes in a path to the project root folder, which is usually where our `main.py` file will be located.

It constructs a path to today’s log file stored in `data/chat_history/{month}/{day}.log`. If the file doesn't exist, it creates an empty file and returns the path. If it does exist, it simply returns the existing path.

The `log_chat_message` function takes the path to the log file, the user message, and the AI message, then logs the received messages with a specific timestamp.

* * *

### [](#api-keys-configuration)API Keys Configuration 🔑

For this project, we will require a few API keys. That includes Groq key, Google Generative AI key and optionally OpenAI key.

Create a new file `.env` in the root of the project and populate it with the API keys.  

```
# Required
GROQ_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=

# Optional
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

After populating the `.env` file with the API keys, it's time to get access to it in our Python code.

Inside the `src` directory, create a new file `setup.py` with the following code:  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/setup.py

import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

import utils


def get_credentials() -> tuple[str, str, str | None]:
    """
    Load API keys from environment variables and return them as a tuple.

    This function loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `dotenv`.
    It retrieves the Groq API key, Google Generative AI API key, and OpenAI API key.
    If any of the keys are missing, it exits the program with an error message.

    Returns:
        tuple[str, str, str | None]: A tuple containing the Groq API key, Google Generative AI API key,
                              and OpenAI API key.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If any of the required API keys are not found, the program exits with an error message.
    """
    load_dotenv()

    groq_api_key: str | None = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
    google_gen_ai_api_key: str | None = os.getenv("GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY")
    openai_api_key: str | None = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    if groq_api_key is None or google_gen_ai_api_key is None:
        return utils.exit_program(
            status_code=1,
            message="Missing required API key(s). Make sure to set them in `.env` file. If you are using the OpenAI approach, then populate the OpenAI api key as well.",
        )

    return groq_api_key, google_gen_ai_api_key, openai_api_key
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `get_credentials` function loads API keys from environment variables using the `dotenv` library and returns them as a tuple.

If either the Groq or Google API keys are missing, the function exits the program with an error message, prompting the user to set the necessary keys in a `.env` file. The OpenAI key is returned as optional and can be None if not set.

* * *

### [](#defining-additional-helper-functions)Defining Additional Helper Functions 👷

Above in the `get_credentials` function in `setup.py`, we are using `utils.exit_program`, but we have not defined it yet.

Let's work on that and add some more helper functions that we will need in the project.

Inside the `utils.py` file in the `src` directory, add the following lines of code:  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/utils.py

# Rest of the code...

def exit_program(status_code: int = 0, message: str = "") -> NoReturn:
    """
    Exit the program with an optional error message.

    Args:
        status_code (int): The exit status code. Defaults to 0 (success).
        message (str): An optional error message to display before exiting.
    """

    if message:
        print(f"ERROR: {message}\n")
    sys.exit(status_code)

def get_path_to_folder(folder_type: Literal["webcam", "screenshot"]) -> Path:
    """
    Get the path to the specified folder type (webcam or screenshot).

    Args:
        folder_type (Literal["webcam", "screenshot"]): The type of folder to retrieve the path for.

    Returns:
        Path: The path to the specified folder.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the folder_type is not valid.
    """

    base_path = Path(os.path.join(Path.home(), "Pictures", "llama3.1"))
    folder_map = {
        "screenshot": Path(os.path.join(base_path, "Screenshots")),
        "webcam": Path(os.path.join(base_path, "Webcam")),
    }

    if folder_type not in folder_map:
        raise ValueError(
            f"ERROR: Invalid folder_type: {folder_type}. Expected 'webcam' or 'screenshot'."
        )

    return folder_map[folder_type]
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `exit_program` as the name suggests it exits the program with a specified status code and optional error message. If a message is provided, it prints it before exiting.

The `get_path_to_folder` function constructs and returns the folder path for a specified folder type, either "webcam" or "screenshot." It combines the user's home directory with a predefined base path ("Pictures/llama3.1") and appends the relevant folder name. We will use this function to store images in the appropriate folder, either for webcam or screenshots.

Now, we will define few more functions that deals with capturing and removing screenshots and getting clipboard text.  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/utils.py

# Rest of the code...

def capture_screenshot() -> Path:
    """
    Captures a screenshot and saves it to the designated folder.

    Returns:
        Path: The file path of the saved screenshot.
    """

    screenshot_folder_path = utils.get_path_to_folder(folder_type="screenshot")

    os.makedirs(screenshot_folder_path, exist_ok=True)

    screen = ImageGrab.grab()

    time_stamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S")
    rgb_screenshot = screen.convert("RGB")

    image_filename = f"screenshot_{time_stamp}.png"
    image_file_path = Path(os.path.join(screenshot_folder_path, image_filename))

    rgb_screenshot.save(image_file_path, quality=20)

    return image_file_path


def remove_last_screenshot() -> None:
    """
    Remove the most recent screenshot file from the designated screenshots folder.

    The function checks if the folder exists and if there are any .png files. If
    found, it deletes the most recently created screenshot.
    """

    folder_path = utils.get_path_to_folder(folder_type="screenshot")

    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):
        return

    files = [
        file
        for file in os.listdir(folder_path)
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(folder_path, file)) and file.endswith(".png")
    ]
    if not files:
        return

    most_recent_file = max(
        files, key=lambda f: os.path.getctime(os.path.join(folder_path, f))
    )

    os.remove(os.path.join(folder_path, most_recent_file))


def get_clipboard_text() -> str:
    """
    Retrieves the current text content from the system clipboard.

    This function uses the `pyperclip` module to access the clipboard. If the clipboard
    content is a valid string, it returns the content. If the content is not a string,
    it returns an empty string.

    Returns:
        str: The text content from the clipboard, or an empty string if the content is
        not a string or the clipboard is empty.
    """

    clipboard_content = pyperclip.paste()

    if isinstance(clipboard_content, str):
        return clipboard_content

    return ""
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `capture_screenshot` function captures the current screen using the **ImageGrab** module, saves it as a PNG file in a designated screenshots folder, and returns the full file path of the saved screenshot. 📸

It constructs the filename with a timestamp to ensure uniqueness and sets a quality of 20 for the saved image. We are degrading the quality of the image so to make it fast to process the image later.

The `remove_last_screenshot` function identifies and deletes the most recently created screenshot from the designated folder. It first checks if the folder exists and looks for .png files within it. If files are found, it uses the creation time to determine the most recent file before removing it. 🚮

The `get_clipboard_text` function uses the `pyperclip` module to access the clipboard. If the clipboard content is a valid string, it returns the content. If the content is not a string, it returns an empty string.

### [](#integrating-webcam-support)Integrating Webcam Support 📸

For capturing images from the webcam, we will have to add support to it.

Inside the `src` directory, create a new file `webcam.py` and add the following lines of code:  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/webcam.py

import os
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
from typing import NoReturn, Union

import cv2

import utils


def get_available_webcam() -> cv2.VideoCapture | None:
    """
    Checks for available webcams and returns the first one that is opened.

    This function attempts to open the first 10 webcam indices. If a webcam is found
    and successfully opened, it returns a VideoCapture object. If no webcams are found,
    it exits the program with an error message.

    Returns:
        cv2.VideoCapture: The opened webcam object.
        None: If no webcam is found, the program exits with an error message.
    """

    # Assuming that we are checking the first 10 webcams.
    for index in range(10):
        web_cam = cv2.VideoCapture(index)
        if web_cam.isOpened():
            return web_cam

    return utils.exit_program(status_code=1, message="No webcams found.")


def capture_webcam_image() -> Union[Path, NoReturn]:
    """
    Captures an image from the available webcam and saves it to the specified folder.

    This function first checks for an available webcam using `get_available_webcam`.
    If a webcam is successfully opened, it creates a folder for saving the images if
    it does not already exist, generates a timestamped filename, captures a frame,
    and saves the image to the specified folder. The function then releases the webcam.

    Returns:
        Path: The file path of the saved image.
        NoReturn: If there was an error capturing the image, the program exits with an error message.
    """

    webcam = get_available_webcam()
    if webcam is None or not webcam.isOpened():
        return utils.exit_program(
            status_code=1, message="There was an error capturing the image."
        )

    webcam_folder_path = utils.get_path_to_folder(folder_type="webcam")

    os.makedirs(webcam_folder_path, exist_ok=True)

    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S")
    image_filename = f"webcam_{timestamp}.png"

    _, frame = webcam.read()

    image_file_path_str = os.path.join(webcam_folder_path, image_filename)

    cv2.imwrite(image_file_path_str, frame)

    webcam.release()

    return Path(image_file_path_str)
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `get_available_webcam` function checks for available webcams, assuming the first ten indices. If a webcam is successfully opened, it returns the corresponding `cv2.VideoCapture` object. 🎥 If no webcams are found, it exits the program with an error message.

The `capture_webcam_image` function captures an image from the available webcam. It first calls our previously written helper function `get_available_webcam` to get an available webcam. If successful, it creates a folder for saving images (if it doesn’t already exist), generates a timestamped filename, captures a frame, and saves the image. Finally, it releases the webcam and returns the path of the saved image. 🖼️

The **Siri** class sets up a multi-modal AI voice assistant that not only handles voice commands but also processes images or clipboard content to add context.

It takes in a few key parameters, like the `log_file_path` and `project_root_folder_path` help with logging conversations and storing AI responses as mp3 files when using gTTS. You’ll also need API keys for Groq, Google Generative AI, and optionally OpenAI. 🤖

The class sets up clients for Groq, OpenAI, and Google Generative AI. For Google GenAI, it uses the **gemini-1.5-flash** model and tweaks some of the safety settings.

An initial conversation prompt is built in to guide the AI on how to respond based on the user’s voice commands or any processed images. 💬

For audio transcription, it uses the Faster Whisper model, which runs on the CPU with specific settings for performance. It also sets up speech recognition using `Recognizer` and `Microphone`, with the assistant listening for the wake word **"siri"** to start taking commands.

Now that the initial configuration is done, let's add some methods to the class. We will define a few more to handle audio transcription, extract the user's prompt, listen for the prompt, and generate chat responses using Groq. 🛠️

Add the following methods in the `siri.py` file inside the `src` directory.  

```

The method `transcribe_audio_to_text` takes the path to an audio file and transcribes its content into text. It uses the WhisperModel to process the audio file in segments and returns a string that concatenates the transcribed text from all segments. 🎧

The method `extract_prompt` extracts the user’s spoken prompt from the transcribed text, specifically after the wake word (e.g., "siri"). It uses a regular expression to find and capture the prompt following the wake word, returning the cleaned-up prompt or `None` if no prompt is found. 🗣️

The method `listen` continuously listens for the wake word and processes audio input. It first adjusts for ambient noise, then starts listening in the background using a callback (`handle_audio_processing`). The method enters an infinite loop, pausing briefly in each iteration to keep listening. 🔄

The method `generate_chat_response_with_groq` generates a response using the Groq model based on the user’s prompt and optional image context. It formats the prompt with the image context (if any), adds the conversation to the model, and appends the AI’s response to the ongoing conversation. It then returns the generated response or a default message if no response is generated. 💬

#### [](#texttospeech-generation)Text-to-Speech Generation 🗣️

For Text To Speech Generation we will be implementing three different approaches. pyttsx3, OpenAI and gTTS (Google Text To Speech). You are free to choose any approach that fits your requirement.

*   **Pyttsx3 Approach**

Here for text to speech generation, we will be using a famous Python Module Pyttsx3.

In the `siri.py` file, add the following method.  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/siri.py

# Rest of the code...

# Pyttsx3 Approach (Weaker Audio Quality)
def text_to_speech(self, text: str) -> None:
    """
    Converts text to speech using Pyttsx3's text-to-speech API.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to convert to speech.
    """

    self.pyttsx3_engine.setProperty("volume", 1.0)
    self.pyttsx3_engine.setProperty("rate", 125)

    voices = self.pyttsx3_engine.getProperty("voices")

    # Set voice to Female.
    self.pyttsx3_engine.setProperty("voice", voices[0].id)

    self.pyttsx3_engine.say(text)
    self.pyttsx3_engine.runAndWait()

    self.pyttsx3_engine.stop()
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `text_to_speech` method uses the `pyttsx3_engine` we initialized inside the Siri class to set some of the properties for the engine and finally say the text that we provide to it.

*   **OpenAI Approach**

For this approach, we will be using the OpenAI Audio speech with streaming. This approach has overall the best experience than any other approaches, but it requires you to have OpenAI API setup and your account having some OpenAI credits.

In the `siri.py` file, add the following method.  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/siri.py

# Rest of the code...

# OpenAI Approach (Best Quality Audio with multiple voice available).
def text_to_speech(self, text: str) -> None:
    """
    Converts text to speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech API.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to convert to speech.
    """

    stream = pyaudio.PyAudio().open(
        format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=24000, output=True
    )
    stream_start = False

    with self.openai_client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
        model="tts-1", voice="nova", response_format="pcm", input=text
    ) as openai_response:
        silence_threshold = 0.1
        for chunk in openai_response.iter_bytes(chunk_size=1024):
            if stream_start:
                stream.write(chunk)

            elif max(chunk) > silence_threshold:
                stream.write(chunk)
                stream_start = True
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `text_to_speech` method converts text into speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech (TTS) API.

It starts by opening an audio stream using `PyAudio`, which is configured to output audio at a sample rate of 24,000 Hz with 16-bit resolution. The method then calls the OpenAI TTS API with the provided text, specifying the model ("tts-1"), voice ("nova"), and response format ("pcm"). The audio data is streamed in real time. 🚀

You can change the voices if you like. For a list of available options, visit [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/overview).

Within the loop, the method checks the audio chunks returned by the OpenAI API. If the audio exceeds a certain silence threshold, the stream begins playing the audio chunks, ensuring the text is spoken only when meaningful sound is detected. This prevents the stream from starting with silence. 🔊

*   **gTTS Approach**

For this approach, we will be using the Google Text to Speech Engine.  
This approach is pretty slow and also there's a need to save the AIs response as an 'mp3' and then play that audio file.

In the `siri.py` file, add the following method.  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/siri.py

# Rest of the code...

def text_to_speech(self, text: str) -> None:
    """
    Converts text to speech using Google's text-to-speech API.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to convert to speech.
    """

    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang="en", slow=False)

    response_folder_path = Path(
        os.path.abspath(
            os.path.join(self.project_root_folder_path, "data", "ai_response")
        )
    )

    os.makedirs(response_folder_path, exist_ok=True)

    response_audio_file_path = Path(
        os.path.join(response_folder_path, "ai_response_audio.mp3")
    )

    tts.save(response_audio_file_path)

    response_audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(response_audio_file_path)
    play(response_audio)

    # After the audio is played, delete the audio file.
    if os.path.exists(response_audio_file_path):
        os.remove(response_audio_file_path)
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The `text_to_speech` method converts text to speech using Google's TTS API. It first generates speech from the given text in English, setting `slow=False` to speed up the playback. The method then creates a folder path for storing the response audio file inside a "data/ai\_response" directory. After ensuring the directory exists, it saves the speech as an mp3 file.

Once the mp3 file is saved, it loads the audio using `AudioSegment` and plays it. After playing the audio, the method deletes the mp3 file to clean up.

* * *

Now, that we've also worked on the `text_to_speech` method, we need to write a few more methods that deals with analyzing image prompt if the user attaches image context to the prompt, select the relevant assistant action and process the audio and take relevant actions.

Add the following code to the `siri.py` file in the `src` directory.  

```
# 👇 siri-voice-llama3/src/siri.py

# Rest of the code...

The `analyze_image_prompt` method analyzes an image based on a user’s prompt to extract semantic information. It starts by opening the specified image file using the PIL library. The method then constructs a prompt that instructs the image analysis AI to focus on extracting relevant data from the image without responding directly to the user.

The method sends the constructed prompt and the image to the Google Generative AI model for processing. Finally, it returns the image analysis result as text. 📝

The `select_assistant_action` method determines the appropriate action for the assistant based on the user's input. 🤔 It starts by creating a system prompt that instructs the AI model to choose from a predefined list of actions: `'extract clipboard', 'take screenshot', 'delete screenshot', 'capture webcam', or 'generic'`.

Next, the method constructs a conversation list that includes the system prompt and the user’s prompt. It then sends this conversation to the Groq client to generate a response using the specified model.  
The response can be any one of the item from the predefined list of actions.

The `handle_audio_processing` method processes audio input after it’s recognized by the assistant. First, it saves the captured audio as a `.wav` file in the "data" folder. It then transcribes the audio to text using the `transcribe_audio_to_text` method and extracts the user’s prompt from the text with `extract_prompt`.

If a prompt is found, it logs the user’s message and determines the appropriate assistant action using `select_assistant_action`. Depending on the action, it may capture a webcam image, take a screenshot, delete a screenshot, or extract clipboard content. For image-based actions, it uses `analyze_image_prompt` to analyze the image. 🔍

The `skip_response` variable is used to control whether the assistant should skip generating and speaking a response after performing certain actions. It is initially set to False, meaning the response generation is expected.

For example, when the action is "delete screenshot," the method deletes the screenshot and directly provides a pre-defined response ("Screenshot deleted successfully.") via text-to-speech. In this case, `skip_response` is set to True to prevent the assistant from generating a separate response for the user prompt, as the action itself is sufficient. ✅

For other actions, it generates a response using `generate_chat_response_with_groq` method and converts the response to speech. After the response is generated, the method deletes the audio file. 🚮

```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

> 👀 Notice that we are inserting the path to our src directory using the `sys.path.insert()` method to ensure that Python can locate and import modules from the `src` directory.

The main block starts by determining the project root folder, then gets the daily log file path using `utils.get_log_file_for_today` to log the chat messages.

Next, we retrieve APIs (for Groq, Google Generative AI, and OpenAI) using `setup.get_credentials` function that we wrote earlier when working on coding some helper functions.

We then create an instance of the Siri class, passing the log file path, project root folder path, and API keys.

Finally, the `siri.listen` method is called, which starts the assistant and listens for user input.

By now, you should have a working version of your own Voice Assitant. 🥂

## [](#optional-building-a-shell-script)Optional: Building a Shell Script 🧰

🤔 **Why is there a need to write a shell script?**

> Well, there is no need to. I actually wrote this shell script myself, thinking that I could automate running it on system reboot through scheduling tools like Linux services or cron jobs. However, I couldn't get it to work since it requires access to hardware components (like the mic), so it didn’t really speak out the response (Do let me know if you find a fix). But this shell script can come in really handy if you want to automate every manual steps, like creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and finally running the program. You could also add the script to your **PATH** via symlink and run it from anywhere on your system. 😉

This script is designed to automate the setup and execution of a Python program, ensuring the necessary environment is prepared before running `main.py`. ⚙️

First, it checks whether a valid Python file (`main.py`) is passed as an argument. If not, it logs an error and exits. It also verifies the file exists and has the correct extension (`.py`). 🐍

The script then searches for a Python executable (`python3` or `python`), and if a virtual environment (venv) doesn't exist, it creates one using Python's `venv` module. Once the venv is created, it activates it, and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` if found. The script ensures that both Python and Bash are installed on the system, as it only supports the Bash shell.

If the user's shell isn't Bash, it logs an error and exits. Otherwise, it runs the Python script (`main.py`) inside the virtual environment using the Python executable found.

Now, to actually be able to run this script from anywhere on your system, you can add it to your **PATH** with symlink. 🔗

Usually, `/usr/local/bin` is a place where we add our custom built scripts. Firstly make sure that it is in your **PATH**, by running the command:  

```
echo $PATH
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

If not add it to your **PATH**, then you can add this script as a symlink to `/usr/local/bin` with the following command:  

```
ln -s {absolute_path_to_script_sh/fish} /usr/local/bin/start_siri_llama3
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

After running this command, you should now be able to run this program from anywhere on your system. 🎉
