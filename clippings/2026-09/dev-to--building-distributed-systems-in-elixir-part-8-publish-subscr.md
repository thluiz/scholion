title: "Building Distributed Systems in Elixir: Part 8 — Publish / Subscribe"
domain: "dev-to"
---

In the previous part of this series, we built a **Worker Pool** from scratch.

We saw how a coordinator process could distribute pending jobs one by one to a pool of available workers, strictly bounding concurrency and establishing demand-driven coordination:  

```
Job 1 ---> [ Coordinator ] ---> Worker 1
Job 2 ---> [ Coordinator ] ---> Worker 2
```

Every interaction in that system was **1-to-1 (point-to-point)**: one coordinator assigning one job to exactly one worker process.

But what happens when an event needs to be received by _multiple_ independent components simultaneously?

Consider a web application or distributed backend:

*   A customer completes a checkout.
*   The **Inventory Service** must adjust stock levels.
*   The **Email Service** must dispatch a confirmation receipt.
*   The **Fraud Detection Service** must analyze transaction velocity.
*   The **Analytics Service** must log the conversion event.

If the order-processing process had to know about and send a message directly to every one of those services, your system becomes tightly coupled, brittle, and difficult to extend.

In this part, we will build a **Publish / Subscribe (PubSub) Broker** from scratch using raw process primitives:  

```
spawn/1
send/2
receive/1
Process.monitor/1
```

No `GenServer`.

No `Registry`.

No `Phoenix.PubSub`.

No RabbitMQ or Redis.

The goal is to understand the core mechanics of 1-to-many communication, topic routing tables, fan-out broadcasting, and subscriber lifecycle management before relying on high-level libraries.

* * *

## [](#the-problem-why-pointtopoint-messaging-falls-short)The Problem: Why Point-to-Point Messaging Falls Short

On the BEAM, message passing with `send/2` is inherently point-to-point:  

```
send(target_pid, message)
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

You have a sender, a recipient PID, and an isolated mailbox.

If a component needs to notify three different processes about an event, the naive approach is to loop over a list of PIDs:  

```
Naively Coupled Publisher:
                    +---> [ Inventory Service ]
                    |
[ Order Producer ] -+---> [ Email Service ]
                    |
                    +---> [ Analytics Service ]
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

While this works for trivial scripts, it introduces three fundamental architectural problems:

1.  **Spatial Coupling**: The producer must know the concrete identity (or PID) of every recipient. If you add a new reporting service, you must modify the order producer.
2.  **Temporal Coupling**: Every recipient must already be known and alive when the producer starts. Subscribers cannot dynamically register or leave without coordinating directly with the producer.
3.  **Failure Exposure & Blast Radius**: If the producer attempts to synchronously verify delivery to each recipient, a slow or crashing consumer can delay or crash the producer itself.

To solve this, distributed architectures rely on the **Publish / Subscribe** pattern.

* * *

## [](#the-publish-subscribe-architecture)The Publish / Subscribe Architecture

The Pub/Sub pattern introduces a central intermediary: the **Broker**.

The system is organized around three roles:

1.  **Publisher**: Produces events tagged with a **topic** (e.g. `:tech_news` or `:sports`). The publisher sends its event to the Broker and has zero knowledge of who (if anyone) is listening.
2.  **Broker**: Maintains an in-memory routing table mapping topics to lists of subscriber PIDs. When an event arrives, the broker fans out the message to every subscriber registered for that topic.
3.  **Subscriber**: Expresses interest in specific topics by registering with the broker. When a broadcast arrives, it handles the event in its own process mailbox without blocking other subscribers.

* * *

## [](#step-1-designing-the-subscriber-process)Step 1: Designing the Subscriber Process

A subscriber is an independent process that receives broadcast notifications. It maintains a small internal state tracking its human-readable name and the total number of events received.

Create `subscriber.exs`:  

```
defmodule Subscriber do
  # ============================================================
  # Subscriber Process
  #
  # A subscriber:
  # 1. Starts with an assigned human-readable name.
  # 2. Listens for broadcast messages sent by the Broker.
  # 3. Processes each received broadcast event.
  # 4. Supports graceful shutdown and crash demonstration.
  # ============================================================

  def start(name) do
    spawn(fn ->
      IO.puts("Subscriber #{name} started with PID #{inspect(self())}")
      loop(name, 0)
    end)
  end

  # ============================================================
  # Subscriber Loop
  #
  # Maintains process state:
  # - name: identifier for logging
  # - received_count: number of broadcasts processed
  # ============================================================

  defp loop(name, received_count) do
    receive do
      # Broadcast message received from the Broker.
      {:broadcast, topic, message} ->
        updated_count = received_count + 1

        IO.puts(
          "[#{name}] Received on #{inspect(topic)}: " <>
            "#{inspect(message)} (total received: #{updated_count})"
        )

        loop(name, updated_count)

      # Query total received message count.
      {:get_count, caller, ref} ->
        send(caller, {:count, ref, received_count})
        loop(name, received_count)

      # Deliberate crash to demonstrate Broker monitor cleanup.
      :simulate_crash ->
        IO.puts("[#{name}] Simulating sudden process crash!")
        exit(:simulated_crash)

      # Graceful shutdown.
      :stop ->
        IO.puts("[#{name}] Stopped gracefully")
    end
  end
end
```

### [](#how-the-subscriber-works)How the Subscriber Works

*   When a message arrives in the form `{:broadcast, topic, message}`, the subscriber updates its local counter and prints the event.
*   Because every subscriber runs in its own BEAM process, slow handling in one subscriber does not prevent another subscriber from processing its messages.
*   We include `:simulate_crash` so we can test how the broker responds when a subscriber dies unexpectedly.

* * *

## [](#step-2-designing-the-broker-state-amp-protocol)Step 2: Designing the Broker State & Protocol

The Broker is the heart of the system. What state must it hold?

1.  **`topics`**: A map from topic names to lists of subscriber PIDs:

```
   %{
     :tech_news => [#PID<0.109.0>, #PID<0.110.0>],
     :sports    => [#PID<0.109.0>, #PID<0.111.0>]
   }
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

1.  **`monitors`**: A map tracking which subscriber processes are currently monitored:

```
   %{
     #PID<0.109.0> => #Reference<0.1.1>,
     #PID<0.110.0> => #Reference<0.1.2>
   }
```

### [](#why-do-we-need-raw-processmonitor1-endraw-in-pubsub)Why Do We Need `Process.monitor/1` in PubSub?

If a subscriber crashes without unsubscribing, its PID remains in the broker's topic map.

In standard Erlang/Elixir, sending a message via `send/2` to a dead PID does **not** crash the sender—it silently fails as a no-op. However:

1.  The dead PID stays in the broker's memory forever (a **memory leak**).
2.  The broker wastes CPU cycles traversing and sending to defunct PIDs on every broadcast.
3.  Subscriber counts reported by the broker become inaccurate.

By monitoring subscribers with `Process.monitor/1` (from [Part 3: Process Monitoring](https://dev.to/pckrishnadas88/building-distributed-systems-in-elixir-part-3-process-monitoring-5b5p)), the broker automatically receives a `{:DOWN, ...}` notification when a subscriber crashes, allowing it to prune the dead PID immediately!

### [](#key-technical-details)Key Technical Details

1.  **Synchronous Subscribe / Unsubscribe**: Notice how `subscribe/3` and `unsubscribe/3` use correlated request-reply (from [Part 2](https://dev.to/pckrishnadas88/building-distributed-systems-with-elixir-02-correlated-request-reply-4b2a)) with `make_ref()`. This ensures that when the client's `Broker.subscribe(...)` call returns, the subscriber is guaranteed to be recorded in the broker's state. There is no race condition where a message published immediately after subscription is dropped.
2.  **Asynchronous Publish**: Publishing via `Broker.publish/3` is fire-and-forget. The publisher sends `{:publish, topic, message}` and immediately proceeds without waiting for subscribers to read or process the message.
3.  **Fan-Out via `Enum.each/2`**: Delivering to $N$ subscribers requires looping through the topic's PID list and executing `send(sub_pid, {:broadcast, topic, message})`. Because `send/2` merely enqueues the term into the recipient process's mailbox and returns immediately, the fan-out loop is exceptionally fast.

* * *

## [](#step-4-putting-it-all-together)Step 4: Putting It All Together

Now let's write a demonstration script that puts our PubSub broker through real-world scenarios:

1.  Spawning multiple subscribers (`Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`).
2.  Registering multi-topic subscriptions.
3.  Broadcasting messages across different topics.
4.  Unsubscribing a process dynamically.
5.  Simulating a subscriber crash and watching the broker automatically prune the dead process.
6.  Performing a graceful shutdown.

Create `pubsub.exs`:  

```
Code.require_file("subscriber.exs", __DIR__)
Code.require_file("broker.exs", __DIR__)

IO.puts("=== 1. STARTING BROKER AND SUBSCRIBERS ===")
broker = Broker.start()

alice = Subscriber.start("Alice")
bob = Subscriber.start("Bob")
charlie = Subscriber.start("Charlie")

Process.sleep(50)

IO.puts("\n=== 2. REGISTERING TOPIC SUBSCRIPTIONS ===")
# Alice subscribes to :tech_news and :sports
Broker.subscribe(broker, :tech_news, alice)
Broker.subscribe(broker, :sports, alice)

# Bob subscribes to :tech_news
Broker.subscribe(broker, :tech_news, bob)

# Charlie subscribes to :sports and :weather
Broker.subscribe(broker, :sports, charlie)
Broker.subscribe(broker, :weather, charlie)

Process.sleep(50)

IO.puts("\n=== 3. BROADCAST MESSAGING ===")

1.  **Topic Isolation**: When `"Elixir 1.18 Released!"` was published to `:tech_news`, only Alice and Bob received it. Charlie's mailbox remained untouched.
2.  **Selective Overlap**: When `"Local team wins championship!"` was published to `:sports`, Alice and Charlie received it, while Bob was untouched.
3.  **Empty Topics**: When publishing to `:finance`, the broker detected 0 subscribers and safely did nothing without errors.
4.  **Dynamic Unsubscribe**: When Bob unsubscribed from `:tech_news`, the next broadcast only reached Alice.
5.  **Monitor Pruning**: When Charlie crashed, the broker received `{:DOWN, ...}`, removed Charlie's PID from `:sports` and `:weather`, and logged the pruning. The subsequent broadcast to `:sports` succeeded cleanly with zero attempts to send to a dead process.

While Publish/Subscribe provides clean decoupling, it introduces specific runtime behaviors on the BEAM that every engineer must understand:

### [](#1-data-copying-vs-reference-counting)1\. Data Copying vs. Reference Counting

When sending a message to $N$ subscribers on the same BEAM node:

*   Terms smaller than 64 bytes are copied into each subscriber process's private heap.
*   Binaries larger than 64 bytes ("refc binaries") are allocated on a shared global heap; sending them simply passes a lightweight pointer and increments a reference counter.

This makes broadcasting large payloads (e.g., JSON payloads, images, or audio chunks) very memory-efficient in Elixir!

### [](#2-the-slow-consumer-problem)2\. The Slow Consumer Problem

In our implementation, broadcasting is fire-and-forget:  

```
Enum.each(subscribers, fn sub -> send(sub, {:broadcast, topic, message}) end)
```

What happens if a publisher produces 1,000 messages per second, but Subscriber $B$ does slow database operations and can only process 10 messages per second?

Because process mailboxes are unbounded by default on the BEAM:

*   Messages pile up in Subscriber $B$'s mailbox.
*   Memory usage grows linearly.
*   Message queue traversal becomes progressively slower.
*   Eventually, the BEAM node exhausts all available RAM and crashes.

This critical challenge is known as **lack of backpressure**.

## [](#how-realworld-elixir-systems-handle-pubsub)How Real-World Elixir Systems Handle PubSub

In production Elixir and Erlang systems, several battle-tested abstractions build on these exact principles:

1.  **`Registry`**: Built into Elixir standard library since Elixir 1.4. Provides decentralized, concurrent pub/sub via concurrent read/write ETS tables with `dispatch/3`.
2.  **`Phoenix.PubSub`**: The industry standard for real-time web applications (e.g. Phoenix Channels, LiveView). Uses process partitioning across multiple pool shards to eliminate single-process message bottlenecks, and integrates Erlang's `:pg` for distributed cluster-wide broadcasting.
3.  **`:pg` (Process Groups)**: Built into OTP 23+. Manages distributed process groups across connected BEAM nodes with automatic network partition handling and node joining/leaving.

## [](#key-technical-takeaways)Key Technical Takeaways

1.  **Decoupling**: Pub/Sub replaces $M \\times N$ direct point-to-point connections with an intermediary broker, allowing publishers and subscribers to scale independently.
2.  **Topic Routing**: Storing subscriptions as `%{topic => [pids]}` enables efficient, content-based message routing.
3.  **Lifecycle Management**: Unsubscribing must clean up monitor references with `Process.demonitor(ref, [:flush])` to avoid leaking system monitors.
4.  **Crash Cleanup**: Using `Process.monitor/1` enables the broker to automatically purge dead processes on `{:DOWN, ...}`, preventing zombie subscriptions.

## [](#next-in-the-series)Next in the Series

Now that our system can broadcast unlimited messages to multiple subscribers, what happens when a subscriber cannot keep up with the incoming flood of events?

In **Part 9: Backpressure**, we'll explore fast producers, slow consumers, mailbox memory exhaustion, and how to build demand-driven flow control to keep systems resilient under heavy load.
